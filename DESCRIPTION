Description: artiFISHal allows you to simulate and sample a population of fish.
    Use it to create an artificial lake and populate it with known numbers of
    fish (identified in species-size groups) to mimic pelagic fish communities.
    Then, sample the fish population with virtual acoustic and midwater trawl
    surveys.
