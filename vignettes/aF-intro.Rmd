The following is an example using the functions in the **artiFISHal** package.  See [README.md](https://github.com/JVAdams/artiFISHal/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on installing the package.

Start by loading the package.

```{r}
library(artiFISHal)
```

## Simulate a Population of Fish

Create a data frame with 18 columns in which each row describes a sub-population of fish to be placed in the artificial lake. The first 11 columns must be completely filled in (no missing values). 

- **G** = character, a one-letter nickname for the group (e.g., fish species and life stage) used in plotting
- **Z** = numeric, mean length (in mm)
- **ZE** = numeric, error around mean length, expressed as SD/mean
- **LWC1**, **LWC2** = numeric, length-weight regression coefficients, where wt = LWC1*len^LWC2, (wt in g, len in mm)
- **LWCE** = numeric, error around weight estimate, expressed as SD(estimate)/estimate
- **TSC1**, **TSC2** = numeric, target strength and length relation coefficients, ts = TSC1 + TSC2*log10(len/10), (ts in db, len in mm)
- **TSCE** = numeric, error around target strength estimate, expressed as SD(estimate)/estimate
- **PropN** = numeric, approximate proportion of population that the row represents (automatically adjusted to ensure they sum to 1)

The last 8 columns may have some missing values. However, in each row, either water depth (WD and WDE) or distance to bottom (D2B and D2BE) must be filled in, but not both. 

- **E** = numeric, mean easting (m)
- **EE** = numeric, error around easting, expressed as SD/mean
- **N** = numeric, mean northing (m)
- **NE** = numeric, error around northing, expressed as SD/mean
- **WD** = numeric, mean water depth (m)
- **WDE** = numeric, error around water depth, expressed as SD/mean
- **D2B** = numeric, mean distance to bottom (m)
- **D2BE** = numeric, error around distance to bottom, expressed as SD/mean

You may find that the easiest way to create this data frame is by entering the information in an external file, e.g., a comma delimited file.  In that case, you would read in the data frame using the `read.csv` function.  The data frame should be all character and numeric variables, so if you use `read.csv`, you should specify `as.is=TRUE`. 

    ExInputs <- read.csv("C:/temp/ExInputs.csv", as.is=TRUE)

For the purposes of this vignette, I will create the data frame using code.

This data frame contains information on six groups of fish in 14 rows of data.  To get some idea of how this works, have a look at rows 3-6 which includes specifications for group A, alewife large.  The sizes of the fish (`Z`, `ZE`, `LWC1`, `LWC3`, `LWCE`, `TSC1`, `TSC2`, and `TSCE`) being simulated are the same in all four rows.  But, the locations of the fish are different: 3.5% are at easting 600 (with SD 2.5 \* 600), 1.5% are at easting 9,000 (SD 0.9 \* 9,000), 1.5% are at easting 17,900 (with SD 0.6 \* 17,900), and 3.5% are at easting 28,900 (SD 0.1 \* 28,900).  All of the groups of fish are located using water depth (`WD` and `WDE`), except for group B, bloater large, which are located using distance to bottom (`D2B` and `D2BE`).

```{r}
ExInputs
```

Now you can use the `SimFish` function to simulate the fish population based on these parameters. 

```{r}
myfish <- SimFish(LakeName="My Lake", LkWidth=30000, LkLength=20000, 
  BotDepMin=20, BotDepMax=100, FishParam=ExInputs, TotNFish=100000, Seed=545)
```

Look at the true total number and weight of each fish group in the population. 

```{r}
myfish$Truth
```

Look at the fish population that you just simulated.  Each row represents a single individual fish. Columns describe the group, location, and size of the fish. 

```{r}
head(myfish$Fish)
```

Simulating a fish population that looks the way you intended may take some trial and error.  If you specify `PlotsPdf = TRUE` in the `SimFish()` function, a pdf file is created with a series of graphs illustrating the fish population that you've simulated to aid in this trial and error process.  Some examples are shown below.

In the process of creating the population, `SimFish` will eliminate fish based on their size (length or weight less than zero or target strength outside the allowable range) or location (easting, northing, water depth, bottom depth, or distance to shore outside their allowable ranges).  You will likely end up with fewer fish than you requested.  But, if you end up with *far* fewer fish than expected, you should look at the proportion of fish excluded to troubleshoot where in the inputs the problem might lie. 

```{r}
myfish$PropExcluded
```

The output from `SimFish` also keeps the inputs that were supplied as arguments for use in later sampling and summarization. 

```{r}
myfish$LakeInfo
myfish$FishInfo
head(myfish$FishParam)
```

## Sample the Fish Population

Once you have the population the way you want it, you can sample the population with a virtual acoustic and midwater trawl survey. 

```{r}
mysurv <- SampFish(SimPop=myfish, NumEvents=10, AcNum=15, AcInterval=30000, 
  AcLayer=10, AcAngle=7, MtNum=30, MtHt=10, MtWd=10, MtLen=2000, Seed=341)
```

in addition to a few graphs summarizing the catch.  The output from `SampFish` has two sample data frames, one for the acoustic targets detected and one for the midwater trawl catch. 

```{r}
head(mysurv$Targets)
head(mysurv$MtCatch)
```

The output from `SampFish` also keeps the inputs supplied as arguments for use in later sampling and summarization. 

```{r}
mysurv$SurvParam
```

## Generate Estimates from the Sample

Estimate the number and biomass of fish per unit area sampled using the `AcMtEst` function which combines the acoustic and midwater trawl data. 

```{r}
perf <- AcMtEst(SimPop=myfish, AcMtSurv=mysurv, Seed=927)
head(perf)
```

The virtual acoustic and midwater trawl surveys carried out by `SampFish` are assumed to be *perfect* with no issues of fish availability, acoustic dead zones, or trawl selectivity.  If you wish to introduce availability or selectivity functions, you may do so in the `AcMtEst` function. 

For the target data, fish are excluded from the sample if they are located in zones unavailable to the acoustic transducer specified with the argument `AcExcl`. 

For the catch data, fish are excluded from the sample if they are located in zones unavailable to the midwater trawl specified with the argument `MtExcl`.  In addition, selectivity curves can be specified for different panels of the midwater trawl using the arguments `PanelProps` and `SelecParam`.  The `PanelProps` argument is used to denote the relative sizes of four different panels in the trawl, from the mouth (outermost panel) to the cod end (innermost panel).  You can get a fish's-eye view of the panel sizes denoted using the `ViewZones` function. 

    ViewZones(PanelProp = c(0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1))

![Dose-effect relation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JVAdams/artiFISHal/master/images/Slide7.PNG)

The `SelecParam` argument is used to denote the mesh selectivity for each fish group (species, life stage) and trawl panel zone.  You can use the `MeshPass` function to determine the largest height (or depth) of a fish that can pass through a single diamond-shaped mesh of a net, provided the size of the mesh `BarMesh`, the height to width ratio of the mesh `H2WRatio`, and the length to height ratio of the fish `L2HRatio`.

```{r}
MeshPass(BarMesh=2, H2WRatio=0.3, L2HRatio=4)
```

A double logistic regression function is used to specify selectivity as a function of fish total length using two slopes and two inflection points.  If you have some notion of what the selectivity curve should look like, you can use the `TuneSelec` function to discover the corresponding parameters using interactive *sliders*. 

    TuneSelec()

![Dose-effect relation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JVAdams/artiFISHal/master/images/Slide10(Custom).PNG)

Once you have chosen the selectivity parameters you want to use, put them in a data frame. 

```{r}
selec <- data.frame(
  G = c("A", "a", "A", "a", "A", "a"),
  Zone = c("mouth", "mouth", "middle", "middle", "aft", "aft"),
  MtL50Small = c(100, 90, 60, 50, 30, 2),
  MtSlopeSmall = c(40, 40, 30, 30, 20, 20),
  MtL50Large = c(180, 180, Inf, Inf, Inf, Inf),
  MtSlopeLarge = c(20, 20, 100, 100, 100, 100))
selec
```

Then you can visually compare the selectivity curves for the different fish groups using the `ViewSelec` function. 

```{r}
ViewSelec(selec)
```

If all looks well, you can now derive estimates from the survey, incorporating these availabilities and selectivities. 

```{r}
imperf <- AcMtEst(SimPop=myfish, AcMtSurv=mysurv, SelecParam=selec, AcExcl=c(5, 10), MtExcl=c(2, 2), Seed=204)
head(imperf)
```





Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format:

- Never uses retina figures
- Has a smaller default figure size
- Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style

## Vignette Info

Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette.

## Styles

The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows:

    output: 
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        css: mystyles.css

## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```

You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML:

    output:
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        fig_caption: yes

Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**.

## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```
